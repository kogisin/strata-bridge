//! # Bridge Proof Crate
//!
//! This crate provides the functionality necessary to prove the inclusion and validity of specific
//! Bitcoin transactions as part of the Strata rollup bridge. It contains data structures and logic
//! to:
//!
//! - Verify sequences of Bitcoin block headers and their corresponding transactions.
//! - Validate checkpoints for the Strata rollup via zero-knowledge proofs.
//! - Prove deposits, claims, and withdrawals between Bitcoin and the Strata rollup.

/// The number of headers after withdrawal fulfillment transaction that must be provided as private

///
/// This is essentially the number of headers in the chain fragment used in the proof.
/// The longer it is the harder it is to mine privately.
// TODO: (@prajwolrg, @Rajil1213) update this once this is finalized.
// It's fine to have a smaller value in testnet-I since we run the bridge nodes and they're
// incapable of constructing a private fork but this needs to be higher for mainnet (at least in the
// BitVM-based bridge design).
// The reason for choosing a lower value is that we want the bridge node
// to be able to generate the proof immediately when it needs to i.e., after it is challenged and
// the timelock between the `Claim` and `PreAssert` transaction has expired, without having to wait
// for a long time for the bitcoin chain to have enough headers after the withdrawal fulfillment
// transaction. This means that this needs to be set to a value that is lower than the
// `pre_assert_timelock` in the bridge params. To facilitate local testing, this has been sent to a
// much smaller value of `10`.
